Homeownership builds equity by providing forced savings, which can put many homeowners in a better financial position than renters.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n However, with median new home prices exceeding $400,000 in the U.S., saving a down payment of 10-20% of the purchase price of a house can feel like an impossible feat. This guide will walk you through the process of saving up for a home purchase and outline tips for finding down payment assistance to lower your initial homebuying expenses.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Key Takeaways\\n\\n\\n* Assess your current financial situation to determine how much house you can afford and how much down payment you need.\\n* Develop a savings plan and cut back on expenses to help you save for a home quickly.\\n* Increase your income through side hustles or additional sources to accelerate your savings.\\n* Explore down payment assistance programs that can provide financial support for first-time homebuyers.\\n\\n## How Long Does It Take To Save a Down Payment?\\n\\n\\n As of the fourth quarter of 2023, the median price for a newly built home in the U.S. was $417,700. Here’s how home prices vary by region:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Northeast: $698,000\\n* Midwest: $363,000\\n* South: $387,300\\n* West: $517,800\\n\\n\\n\\n However, even if you live in a high-[cost-of-living](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100214/how-cost-living-index-calculated.asp) area, you shouldn’t assume you’ll need to save $100,000 or more for your down payment. According to a National Association of Realtors (NAR) report, most first-time homeowners will put between 6% and 7% down on home purchases. In addition, you can expect to pay another 3%-6% of the home’s purchase price in [closing costs](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/mortgage-guide/closing-costs/).\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume you’ll need about $40,000 to cover the down payment and closing costs on your home. Here are some timelines on how long that could take based on your savings rate:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n| Time To Save Up a Downpayment | |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Savings rate | Years to reach $40,000 |\\n| $1,000/month | 3.33 (40 months) |\\n| $1,500/month | 2.22 years (26.67 months) |\\n| $2,000/month | 1.67 years (20 months) |\\n| $2,500/month | 1.33 years (16 months) |\\n| $3,000/month | 1.11 years (13.33 months) |\\n| $3,500/month | .95 years (11.43 months) |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Although a lower down payment can help many people get into a home sooner than later, there’s also a strong case for putting more money down if possible. Dr. Ohan Kayikchyan, Ph., is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) and founder of [Ohan The Money Doctor](https://www.ohanthemoneydoctor.com/).\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n He says, “The ideal scenario is to have at least 20% of your potential purchase price saved as a down payment, although there are other options and programs available to buy a house with a smaller down payment, starting from 3.5%.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Dr. Kayikchyan adds, “Keep in mind that for lower down payments, you are [often] going to be required to maintain private mortgage insurance (PMI) and pay a mortgage insurance premium. Hence, with a lower down payment, your potential monthly housing expense usually is higher.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Whether you choose to put more (or less) down on your home, you’ll still need a significant amount of money to get to the closing table. It may seem impossible to save so much in a short period of time, but it can be doable with a plan.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 1. Assess Your Current Financial Situation\\n\\n\\n Figure out where you are financially. If you’re not managing your money well, adding a home to the mix could only end up in disaster.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Determine if there are some financial missteps, habits, or circumstances to address. This might include catching up on late payments, correcting your credit report, or paying down some debt to improve your financial situation.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n In this exercise, you’ll also evaluate your income, expenses, and debt to determine how much house you can afford and what the down payment and closing costs expenses will be related to a house in that price range.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Of course, you’ll check with your lender for exact approval requirements, but here’s a high-level list of how to [financially prepare for homeownership](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091415/5-financial-prerequisites-buying-house.asp):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* **Credit score**: Get your credit report and find out your credit score. Most lenders require a minimum credit score of 620 or above for conventional mortgages.\\n* **Debt-to-income ratio**: Make sure your [debt-to-income ratio (DTI)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp) is in line with lender standards. DTI ratio measures the percentage of your gross income you pay out each month to satisfy debts. Most banks will set a DTI ratio upper limit of 43% and may prefer to lend to borrowers with a DTI ratio of less than 36%.\\n* **Documentation**: Gather pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements, and investment account statements.\\n\\n\\n\\n## 2. Set a Clear Savings Goal\\n\\n\\n The [28/36 rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/twenty-eight-thirty-six-rule.asp) is one approach to determining the maximum amount of debt a household should carry. The rule states that an individual or household should spend no more than 28% of gross monthly income on total housing expenses and not more than 36% on servicing debt, which includes their mortgage plus other debt such as credit card payments.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n For example, if you earn a gross income of $4,000 per month and follow the 28/36 rule, your maximum monthly mortgage payment should be no higher than $1,120 or 28% of your monthly income. Your total monthly debt payment shouldn’t exceed $1,440 per month or 36% of your monthly income, which means you can afford up to $320 in other debt. If you pay more than $320 monthly to service your debt, you need to lower your mortgage payment estimate accordingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Once you’ve calculated your maximum allowable monthly housing payment, it will be easier to come up with your total housing budget and determine the down payment required.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\nIf you get stuck crunching any of these numbers, use a [mortgage calculator](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-calculator-5084794) or speak with your loan officer for an exact estimate.\\n\\n\\n### Remember Other Housing Costs\\n\\n\\n Consider the true cost of homeownership when you set your budget.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n “Speak with a financial advisor and mortgage broker to understand what you can realistically afford without making yourself ‘house poor,’” says [Jason Anbara](https://northlendfinancial.com/our-team/), founder and president of NorthLend Financial, Inc. in Ottawa, Ontario. “The cost of your home is not just the monthly payment you make to the principal balance on your mortgage loan. There are also taxes, insurance, interest on the loan, and all the maintenance costs and bills associated with keeping the home in good condition.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n After careful consideration and consultation with all the appropriate professionals, you should have an actual number for your savings goal. From here, it’s time to adjust your financial habits and budget to accommodate a monthly savings amount.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Savings Goal Example\\n\\n\\n If your gross income is $5,000 each month, then you’d want your monthly mortgage payments, including taxes and insurance, to stay between $1,250 and $1,500. You should also account for expenses related to maintenance, repairs, and other miscellaneous costs associated with owning a home, which may lower your maximum allowable monthly payment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The home price based on these payments will depend on many factors, including your creditworthiness, down payment amount, property taxes, homeowners insurance rates, and prevailing interest rates.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\nWith a 7% interest rate, you could afford a home of about $185,000, with a down payment of about $14,000 and an estimated $6,000 in closing costs, for a total of about $20,000 needed to get to the closing table.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n## 3. Develop a Savings Plan\\n\\n\\n If you aren\\'t satisfied with how much money you can save based on your budget, it might be time to tweak your savings plan. This could include some creative strategies like:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Setting up a Separate Savings Account\\n\\n\\n Trying to save extra money in the same checking account you use for expenses means you could be mixing money and constantly dipping into your home down payment savings. Plus, checking accounts typically don’t pay very high interest. Separate your down payment funds into a savings account. Make sure it pays a decent interest rate to boost your savings.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Note that where you put your money matters. Because you’ll likely need this money in less than five years, you should avoid putting it in any type of investment account, like a brokerage account or mutual fund. Instead, put it in a [high-yield savings account](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/high-yield-savings-account.asp) or money market account.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n If you want to be extra disciplined, you can put your money in a certificate of deposit (CD,) but you need to be mindful of early withdrawal penalties should you need your money sooner than the maturity date.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Automate Your Savings\\n\\n\\n Another strategy is to have money automatically deducted from your paycheck. Most employers will allow you to split your paycheck into separate accounts for direct deposit. Use this feature to make sure you are saving a certain amount of money every single paycheck. Send it directly to your down payment savings account so that you aren’t tempted to withdraw money frequently from the funds earmarked for your down payment fund.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Lifestyle Changes\\n\\n\\n If you’re looking to accelerate your savings rate, it might be time to do a lifestyle overhaul. This may include moving in with relatives to save on rent costs, taking on side gigs, aggressively paying down debt, or other drastic measures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Use Your 401(k)\\n\\n\\n Though generally not the preferred way to save for a home, there are IRS rules that allow employees to borrow money from their employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement account for the purpose of purchasing a primary residence.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n You must repay the loan within five years. If you are separated from your job, e.g., you are fired or quit, then you will have to repay the loan much quicker or face penalties and fees on what the IRS would consider an early withdrawal—which can make this move risky for some people.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 4. Cut Back on Expenses\\n\\n\\n Cutting or eliminating expenses can be a great way to free up money for your savings goal. Here are a few expenses you can reduce or eliminate:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Cable and streaming\\n* Dining out, entertainment, and travel\\n* Call to get customer retention discounts from providers for services like insurance, cable, cellphone, internet, security monitoring, pest control, and lawn care\\n* Recurring subscriptions\\n\\n\\n\\n## 5. Increase Your Income\\n\\n\\n Adding more income to your budget can also accelerate your savings progress. Some ideas to increase your income include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Getting a promotion at your job\\n* Changing jobs for a higher-paying position\\n* Take on side hustles\\n* Start a small business\\n* Sell items around the house for extra money\\n* Look for [passive income opportunities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveincome.asp)\\n* Adjusting your income tax withholding\\n\\n\\n\\n## 6. Explore Down Payment Assistance Programs\\n\\n\\n Getting down payment assistance can potentially reduce the amount of money you’ll need to save for your home purchase. There are many ways to purchase a home with little to no money down—ranging from 0% down loans to government and bank-sponsored assistance. Depending on where you’re buying, there could be funds available at the city, county, state, and federal levels.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n There are also lender-specific programs that may offer down payment assistance. The assistance may come in the form of a forgivable or deferred payment loan or grant. There are also rent-to-own and new construction developers that offer incentives, which often include covering a portion of closing costs.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n These programs tend to have strict requirements, such as being a first-time homeowner, working in a certain profession, buying in an eligible area, and meeting other lending criteria like a minimum credit score.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Finally, you can also ask for seller concessions, which may include the seller paying a portion of your closing costs. However, the maximum limits depend on the type of loan you have. Speak with your mortgage loan officer to understand the financial assistance options and strategies to reduce closing costs you may qualify for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n In the meantime, here are some options to explore:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* [FHA loans](https://www.hud.gov/buying/loans)\\n* [VA loans](https://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/)\\n* [USDA loans](https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/single-family-housing-programs/single-family-housing-guaranteed-loan-program)\\n* [HUD Good Neighbor Next Door Program](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/reo/goodn/gnndabot)\\n* [NACA housing program](https://www.naca.com/naca-programs/)\\n* [Local homebuying programs](https://www.hud.gov/buying/localbuying) (based on city, state, and county)\\n\\n\\n\\n## 7. Save Windfalls and Extra Income\\n\\n\\n Getting a large influx of cash can help you reach your savings goals even faster. Some cash windfalls are expected, like a tax refund or a holiday bonus. Others may be unexpected, like a legal settlement or an inheritance.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Either way, make up your mind ahead of time that you’ll use all or a portion of any windfall or extra income that comes your way. Avoid temptation by earmarking these funds in your monthly budget and sending them directly to your savings account once you get them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 8. Monitor and Adjust Your Savings Plan\\n\\n\\n As you’re saving up for your home, you should regularly revisit your spending plan and your progress toward your goal. That way, if you get off track, you can make more adjustments along the way.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Stay motivated by posting a graphical representation of your savings progress somewhere visible. Every time you reach a milestone, you can celebrate by updating your savings tracker—think a debt thermometer or a pie chart printable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Finding motivation can be hard when you experience setbacks like unexpected expenses, job loss, or medical emergencies. The key is staying on track as much as possible and celebrating your savings progress, even if it’s not perfect.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ## In Addition to the Mortgage Payment, What Other Costs Should I Consider?\\n\\n\\nYou should consider the costs of maintenance and repairs for your home. If you are part of a homeowner’s association (HOA), you should budget for monthly or annual payments and assessments.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ## Can I Buy a House With No Down Payment?\\n\\n\\nYes. Government-backed loans such as FHA (3.5% down), VA (0% down), and USDA (0% down) loans require little to no money down for a home purchase. You can see a list of local down payment assistance programs at [www.hud.gov](https://www.hud.gov/buying/localbuying) as well.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ## Is It Better To Pay off Debt or Save for a Down Payment First?\\n\\n\\nMortgage lenders want you to have no more than a 36%-43% DTI. If your DTI is too high, paying down high-interest debt can help you qualify for a loan and free up your budget so you can afford a home.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## The Bottom Line\\n\\n\\n When home prices soar, saving for a house can feel like an impossible goal. But with the right information and savings plan, you can develop a strategy to put together a down payment. Take an honest look at your finances, set a budget, and consider using windfalls and down payment assistance plans to your advantage. The sooner you start saving, the sooner you can make your dream of homeownership into a reality.\\xa0  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n It’s possible to save for a home and retirement at the same time, but this kind of financial multitasking requires careful planning, prioritizing, and budgeting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n “A big mistake I see people make is having an ‘all or nothing’ attitude with money. Either be completely debt-free or invest. Either save up to buy a home or invest,” says [Kris Whipple](https://kristophercurtis.com/about/), partner and financial advisor at Kristopher Curtis Financial in Nashville, Tennessee. “I say do both. If the house is more important to you, lean that way, but don’t give up the opportunity of [compounding](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compounding.asp) growth.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Key Takeaways\\n\\n\\n* Saving for a home and your retirement simultaneously requires careful consideration of each goal’s place in your financial plan.\\n* To safeguard your financial health, prioritize paying off high-interest debts, adding to an emergency fund, and paying into a retirement account.\\n* Home equity can benefit you financially, but retirement savings may be critical to supplement Social Security payments and pay for essentials later in life.\\n* A financial professional can provide personalized guidance to help you make smart savings decisions for both goals.\\n\\n Saving for a home and your retirement at the same time is a balancing act, even with a [budget](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/budget.asp). If you haven’t prepared for retirement and are closer to it, choosing long-term financial stability should take priority.\\xa0If you want to balance both, here’s what you should know.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Impact on Your Budget\\n\\n\\n When you are trying to meet multiple, large [financial goals](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/100516/setting-financial-goals/) (in this case, buying a home and saving for retirement), the key is to make a budget that you can stick with. A realistic budget will allow you to track your cash flow and help you work toward gaining long-term financial stability.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The [50/30/20 budget rule](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/022916/what-502030-budget-rule.asp) can help you save for retirement while paying off your debts. The method works by dividing your after-tax pay into three buckets: needs (50%), wants (30%), and savings (20%).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* **Needs (50%)**: Housing, transportation, groceries, utilities, minimum debt payments\\n* **Wants (30%)**: Entertainment, eating out, gym memberships, travel\\n* **Savings (20%)**: Debt repayments beyond the minimum, retirement funds, emergency funds\\n\\n\\n\\n If you want to buy a home, reducing your debt is critical to getting a good mortgage rate or even a loan. Try to keep your [debt-to-credit ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp#:~:text=to%2DIncome%20Ratio%3F-,As%20a%20general%20guideline%2C%2043%25%20is%20the%20highest%20DTI%20ratio,a%20mortgage%20or%20rent%20payment.) lower than 36% and improve your [credit score](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp) as you pay down your credit cards. Having a low debt-to-credit ratio is not only good for loans but also important as you head into retirement, because carrying it into retirement may lower your quality of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n If you have to use retirement funds and Social Security to pay down high-interest debts, it means less money for essentials and extras, like travel, that may be important to you. If your [debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debt.asp) increases over time, you risk running through your retirement savings to keep up with payments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Taking stock of your debts before retirement and planning to pay them down will help protect your financial security.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Impact on Cash Flow\\n\\n\\n Buying a home can have short- and long-term impacts on cash flow:\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Short-Term Impacts\\n\\n\\n If you use all your savings for a down payment, you risk becoming [house poor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/housepoor.asp). Remember that you will not have access to cash from your house until you’ve had a chance to build [equity in the property](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/home_equity.asp).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Lenders will typically require you to have at least 20% equity in your home to apply for a [home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC)](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/home-equity-vs-heloc/). Plus, it can take 30 days or more to get approved to [borrow from your home’s equity](https://www.investopedia.com/how-long-to-get-home-equity-loan-5323851), meaning you may have to wait to get your cash.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n However, some experts say a mortgage is a good way to hold onto cash in the form of equity. If you have enough equity in your home at retirement age, selling and downsizing (even to a rental) may provide an influx of cash and allow you to be free from the hidden costs of homeownership.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n “In paying a mortgage, you are unknowingly putting even money into a retirement savings bank, in the form of paid-down asset and big-time equity,” says [Rhett Wiseman](https://section8coaching.com/), a private real estate investor and founder of Wiseman Advising LLC.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n But owning a home without adequate retirement savings may be risky regarding access to cash.\\xa0For example, if you need to replace your roof or have an unforeseen emergency, like a burst pipe, you may have to pull from savings to fix it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n In addition, lawn and yard care may be costly, or if you pay for gas or oil to heat your home and the charges go up, those are all financial hits that can add up over time. If you cannot maintain your home, it may lose some of its value over time due to disrepair.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Long-Term Impacts\\n\\n\\n Managing the expenses that come with homeownership can be difficult after retirement, especially if you rely on Social Security. The National Institute of Retirement Security reports that 40.2% of retirees live solely on Social Security payments, with the average monthly benefits being approximately $1,860. This may not be enough to cover home maintenance, as well as food, medicine, and other necessities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n “Inadequate retirement savings can lead to a reduced standard of living and extended working years, while not owning a home means missing potential asset appreciation and tax benefits,” says [William Bevins](https://williambevins.com/), a certified financial planner (CFP) and certified trust and fiduciary advisor (CTFA) for Cypress Capital in Franklin, Tennessee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Between the two goals, “prioritizing retirement savings is usually advisable,” he says.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Consider All Your Financial Priorities\\n\\n\\n When contemplating how to save for a home and retirement, it’s a good idea to evaluate your personal goals and circumstances, like your age, current and potential future [income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/income.asp), your spouse or partner’s contribution, and your timelines for retirement and purchasing your first home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n For example, suppose you are planning to start a family or have a new baby. In that case, you will have to set aside money to [pay for related costs](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/budgeting-for-baby.asp) like anything not covered by your insurance for the birth, adoption costs, new baby gear, and ongoing expenses like child care, if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Families with young children may want to add to a college fund, which will also take dollars out of your budget. If your children are older, you are part of the [sandwich generation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sandwichgeneration.asp), and may also be caring for aging parents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Whatever your stage in life, your dollars will always have to stretch further if you are prioritizing a home and retirement simultaneously. And your goalposts for each item will likely be very different at 25 than at 45. Financial security will become more important as you age; any amount you can put toward retirement is crucial.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n “A 25-year-old can afford a more balanced approach,” Bevins says. “Leveraging the long-term benefits of compounding interest for retirement while also saving for a home down payment is possible, but this age allows for greater flexibility and risk taking.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n That is less the case if you are 20 years older. “For a 45-year-old, the focus should be on boosting retirement savings due to the limited time remaining until retirement,” Bevins says. “While balancing homeownership goals is possible, retirement savings should take precedence to ensure financial security, [and] tailoring advice to each client’s age and personal situation is an important factor for effective financial planning.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## How to Balance Both Financial Goals\\n\\n\\n It’s possible to save for retirement and housing goals simultaneously; some experts say purchasing a home *is* an investment in your retirement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n “Believe it or not, but when buying a primary home, you are actually killing two birds with one stone: homeownership and retirement savings,” Wiseman says. “The largest asset and most expensive purchase that most people will ever make in their lifetime will be their primary home. We can use our home as both a place and a family, but also as a significant driver in saving for retirement.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Here’s how to work toward buying a home and saving enough for retirement:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Determine How Much to Save\\n\\n\\n One of the biggest financial hurdles you may face as a homebuyer is affording a down payment. In 2022, 80% of buyers financed their home purchase, and the average down payment for first-time buyers was 8%, according to data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n If saving 8% or more feels too difficult, then government-insured mortgage programs like [Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fhaloan.asp) only call for a 3.5% deposit, making them more accessible than conventional mortgages for first-time buyers. (Keep in mind that these loans—and conventional ones with down payments lower than 20%—require mortgage insurance. If you have to pay mortgage insurance, these lower-cost mortgage loans may mean paying more in the long run.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n If you or your spouse is an armed services member or veteran, you may qualify for a [mortgage loan from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valoan.asp), which calls for zero down.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\nThe median home price across the United States will be $389,500 in 2024, according to the NAR.\\xa0However, that price will likely be lower or higher, depending on where you live. If you are on a tight budget, consider smaller and less expensive homes on the market.\\n\\n\\n Like all loans, the higher your credit score, the better your [interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) on a mortgage loan will likely be, and the more money you can pay upfront for a home, the more equity you have out of the gate. Home equity is the current value of your home minus your mortgage. As you get older, you retain more ownership of your home. Equity is valuable in retirement because as you pay down your loan, you can access more money in a sale or cash-out refinance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Diversify Your Assets\\n\\n\\n While home equity is an asset in retirement, it shouldn’t be your only one.\\xa0To be adequately prepared for retirement, most financial planners advise saving at least 70% to 80% of pre-retirement income. The proverbial [three-legged stool](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/three-legged-stool-retirement.asp) of retirement consists of Social Security, personal savings (in accounts like certificates of deposit [CDs], savings accounts, and mutual funds), and employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s and/or individual retirement accounts (IRAs).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Anything you can automate each month toward your retirement can help you stay on track. Maxing out your retirement contributions every year, opening a spousal IRA (if it applies to you), taking advantage of any [employer-match plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/matchingcontribution.asp) like a 403(b) or 401(k), and investing in simplified employee pension (SEP) IRAs and Solo 401(k) accounts as an [individual or small business owner](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/082515/best-ways-save-retirement-without-ira-or-401k.asp) are all ways to set money aside for your retirement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Establish Timelines\\n\\n\\n When you plan for long-term financial stability, it can help to establish a timeline for your goals. Having a sense of when you hope to achieve certain financial priorities can help you see the big picture, plan your budget, and stay on track with your daily spending and savings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n For example, let’s say that you plan to buy a home. Setting a timeline can help determine how much you need to save each paycheck for your down payment. It will also factor into your choice of savings plan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n “If you plan on purchasing a home within three years, we typically suggest holding your down payment in cash in checking, regular savings, or high-yield savings accounts—or in near-cash accounts and investments like CDs or money market funds,” says [Ryan Viktorin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fidelityryanviktorin/), CFP, vice president and financial consultant at Fidelity.\\xa0“This guarantees you’ll have access to the funds when you need them and protects them from the inevitable ups and downs of the market.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Similarly, your retirement timeline will depend on how old you are and how long you want to wait to retire. The full retirement age for Gen X and millennials, as of 2024, is 67. Subtract your current age from 67 to determine how long you must contribute to a retirement fund. For example, if you are 30 years old, you will have 37 years to contribute to an account. If you are 40, you have 27 years, and so forth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n If you are saving for a home, you may need more time to max out your retirement contributions. Consider what you can affordably contribute, and increase your retirement contributions as you age.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\nAs of 2024, you can invest $23,000 (or $30,500 if you are age 50 or older) a year into your 401(k) or 403(b) and up to $7,000 in an IRA (or $8,000 if you are 50 or older), assuming you meet the criteria.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n### Simplify Your Savings\\n\\n\\n Automating your savings can help you simplify the process of achieving your goals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n If your employer offers a [401(k) or 403(b)](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/what-difference-between-401k-plan-and-403b-plan.asp) retirement plan, especially one with employer-matching opportunities, experts agree that you should sign up for it. This gives you a tax advantage, and automating monthly payments can keep you from being tempted to skip a payment to your retirement fund.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Usually, the money earmarked for your retirement account is automatically withdrawn (pretax) from your paycheck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n “Missing out on an employer match to free up additional money for a down payment is generally not advisable, for example, since you’d be leaving free money on the table,” Viktorin says. In addition, you or your spouse, if you have one, could consider opening an IRA to diversify your retirement funds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### House Hacking\\n\\n\\n One idea for supplementing your retirement income is to use real estate investments to support your retirement savings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n “House hacking is a phenomenal way to build real estate assets using lower residential financing for owner-occupied homes,” Wiseman says. “This is a strategy where a buyer purchases a home at an owner-occupied interest rate and down payment percentage, lives in it for 12 months, and then moves out and rents the unit. They continue this practice yearly until they’ve been able to amass a strong [portfolio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp). This is a great way to add units to your portfolio if it’s harder to obtain capital.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n House hacking is one way to support retirement savings if you have a disposable income and don’t mind moving from home to home. Wiseman says this method is appealing because “owner-occupied residential purchases require anywhere from 3% to 10% down payments, while investment property usually requires 15% to 25% down payments, on average.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n However, he says, “This allows for people to take on more [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp) and use less cash, which isn’t always a good thing.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\nHouse hacking may not be for you if you are on a budget or struggling to make retirement contributions.\\n\\n\\n## More Ways to Boost Savings\\n\\n\\n There are other ways to supplement savings and build assets for retirement. Consider [passive income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveincome.asp) streams, such as renting a room in your home or your primary residence over weekends and holiday breaks via a home-sharing platform. If you have the money, buying a second home could set you up to earn rental income, although it may be a reach to purchase another property if saving for the first one is difficult.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Other ways to supplement savings for a [down payment on a home](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/110515/5-unusual-ways-come-home-down-payment.asp) could include renting a smaller and cheaper apartment for a period while you save, taking on a [side hustle](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0712/how-to-start-a-side-business.aspx#:~:text=A%20side%20hustle%2C%20or%20a,passionate%20about%20or%20skilled%20at.), and/or asking your friends or family for a financial gift (the Internal Revenue Service allows gift exclusions of up to $18,000) that they can write off their taxes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Seeking Professional Advice\\n\\n\\n A fee-only [financial advisor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-advisor.asp) or [planner](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialplanner.asp) can help you create a personalized plan designed for your situation. Financial advisors and financial planners can help you create a budget, decide which financial vehicles to use for savings goals like [purchasing a home](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/how-long-should-it-take-save-down-payment/), and make a timeline for meeting them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n “No matter your life stage or current financial picture, meeting with a financial advisor is a great step towards achieving your money goals and improving your financial wellness,” Viktorin says. “There are also a lot of digital tools available online to help you understand your expenses and savings goals if you don’t feel quite ready to meet with someone yet.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n [Financial apps](https://www.investopedia.com/best-budgeting-apps-5085405), like Simplifi by Quicken, or digital tools like AARP’s Money Map and others, can help you budget for your financial goals and may offer some general guidance on saving for priorities like owning a home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n In addition, most large banks, credit unions, and investment firms may offer one-time free consultations, help you create a [free plan](https://www.fidelity.com/what-we-offer/planning), or provide digital tools on their websites to help you get started.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\nIf you’re a millennial with your eyes on retirement, there are more resources [here](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/122815/how-much-millennials-should-save-retire-comfortably.asp) to help support your financial future.\\n\\n\\n ## What Retirement Savings Vehicles Should I Consider for Long-term Financial Stability?\\n\\n\\nIf your employer offers an employer-match retirement plan, like a 401(k) or 403(b), take advantage of it. Traditional and Roth IRAs, plus SEP IRAs and Solo 401(k)s, are options for individuals and small business owners. Always check the criteria for any retirement account type to make sure it is a good fit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ## Is It Better to Save for a House or Retirement?\\n\\n\\nMost experts agree that putting money into retirement is critical for a financially secure old age. While renting may not let you reap the tax or potential savings (via equity) benefits, being forced to live on Social Security payments alone because you have no retirement savings may not be enough to pay for necessities. So, if you need to prioritize one over the other due to budget constraints or other goals, focus on retirement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ## Is It Better to Pay Off a House or Put Money Aside for Retirement?\\n\\n\\nYour circumstances and financial picture should help you determine the best path forward. “Deciding between paying off a mortgage or investing in a retirement fund with a cash windfall depends on factors like interest rates and personal financial goals,” Bevins says. “Both options have merits, with mortgage repayment offering peace of mind and retirement investments potentially yielding higher long-term returns.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## The Bottom Line\\n\\n\\n Most experts agree that retirement savings should take precedence over other kinds of savings, but that doesn’t need to obstruct the path to homeownership.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n [Prioritize your savings goals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goalbased-investing.asp) by creating and adhering to a budget, automating retirement contributions, taking advantage of employer matching, cutting back on nonessentials, and using timelines to help you stay on task. Talk to a financial advisor or use online tools to help you calculate your retirement budget and decide how much house and mortgage you can afford to take on. A little planning now can help you minimize financial risk later.\\n\\n\\n\\n A home is an important part of life—it\\'s where memories are made, and families are grown. But it is one of the most expensive purchases you\\'ll ever make, so like many people, you\\'re likely asking yourself how to ensure you get approved for a mortgage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n There are many ways to prepare for home ownership—you can use a co-signer, wait for better market conditions, improve your credit score and report, find a less expensive home, ask for an exception, or find another lender. Keep reading to learn about these six tips and how they can help you position yourself for purchasing a home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Key Takeaways\\n\\n\\n* A co-signer can give your bank or lender the confidence it needs in your finances to approve your request.\\n* Consider waiting for the housing market to swing in your favor or for interest rates to drop.\\n* Credit reports and scores can make the difference in getting a mortgage approval.\\n* If you\\'re disapproved because you don\\'t make enough income, consider looking for a less expensive home.\\n* You may be able to ask your lender for an exception, find another lender, or you could consider an FHA loan.\\n\\n## 1. Get a Co-Signer\\n\\n\\n If your income isn\\'t [high enough](https://www.investopedia.com/home-loan-options-for-lower-income-households-5194262) to qualify for the loan you\\'re applying for, a co-signer can help. A co-signer helps you because their income will be included in the affordability calculations. Even if the person isn\\'t living with you and only helping you make the monthly payments, the bank will consider a co-signers income. Of course, the key factor is to ensure that your co-signer has a good employment history, stable income, and good credit history.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n In some cases, a co-signer may also be able to compensate for your less-than-perfect credit. The co-signer guarantees the lender that your mortgage payments will be paid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n It\\'s important that both you and the co-signer understand the financial and legal obligations that come with cosigning a mortgage loan. If you default on your mortgage, the lender can go after your co-signer for the full amount of the debt. Also, if payments are late or you default, both parties\\' credit scores will suffer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\nIt would be best not to rely on your co-signer to make payments. They are there to appease the lender\\'s worry that you might be unable to make your payments, not make your payments for you—unless that is the arrangement you\\'ve made with them.\\n\\n\\n## 2. Wait\\n\\n\\n Sometimes conditions in the economy, the housing market, or the lending business makes lenders stingy when approving loans. Regulators scrutinize banks to ensure they\\'re not taking on more risk than they can handle. If the economy doesn\\'t support a [robust housing market](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/033015/top-us-housing-market-indicators.asp) where banks are actively lending, perhaps it\\'s best to wait until the market improves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n While you\\'re waiting, home prices or interest rates could fall. Either of these changes could also improve your mortgage eligibility. On a $290,000 loan, for example, a rate drop from 7% to 6.5% will decrease your monthly payment by about $100. That may be the slight boost you need to afford the monthly payments and qualify for the loan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 3. Work on Boosting Your Credit Score\\n\\n\\n You can work on improving your credit score, reducing your debt, and increasing your savings. To work on your credit score, you should first obtain a copy of your credit report. The Federal Trade Commission has helpful information about getting a free credit report on its website. The report will list your credit history, open loans, credit card accounts, and track record for making timely payments. Once you have the report, you can obtain your credit score from one of the three credit agencies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\nYou\\'re allowed one free credit report a year from each of the three credit rating agencies.\\n\\n\\n### Build Your Credit History\\n\\n\\n If you don\\'t have a lot of credit history, it can hurt your chances of getting approved for a mortgage. Consider opening a secured credit card with a small credit limit. Secured cards require you to have an amount of cash saved with the credit card company that matches the card\\'s available credit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n A secured card eliminates the credit card company\\'s risk, which improves your chances of getting approved. Also, a secured credit card is a great way to build your credit history and show banks you can borrow from a card and pay off the balance each month. However, if you have too many cards open, opening another one may hurt your credit score.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Manage Your Credit Cards\\n\\n\\n Making on-time payments is critical to boosting your score. Also, pay off some of your debt so that your card balances are not close to the card\\'s credit limit, called credit utilization. Credit utilization is a ratio reflecting the percentage of a borrower’s available credit that\\'s being utilized.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n For example, if a credit card with a $5,000 limit has a $4,000 balance, the ratio is 80% or ($4,000 (balance owed) /$5,000 (limit)). In other words, 80% of the card\\'s available credit has been used. Ideally, the lower the percentage, the better, but [many lenders](https://www.investopedia.com/best-online-mortgage-lenders-7372752) like to see at least a 30% or lower utilization ratio.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n If banks see that you\\'re close to maxing out your cards, they\\'ll view you as a credit risk. For example, if you can\\'t make timely payments or reduce a credit card with a $3,000 balance over time, banks are unlikely to believe you can repay a $200,000 mortgage loan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Calculate Your Debt-to-Income Ratio\\n\\n\\n Banks love to analyze your total monthly household debt as it relates to your monthly income, called the [debt-to-income ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dti.asp). First, total your monthly gross income (before taxes are taken out). Next, total your monthly debt payments, which include a car loan, credit cards, charge cards, and student loans. You\\'ll divide your total monthly bills by your gross monthly income.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n If, for example, your debt payments total $2,000 per month and your gross income is $5,000 per month, your debt-to-income ratio is 0.40 ($2000/$5,000), or 40%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Ideally, banks like to see a debt-to-income ratio lower than 43%. As a result, it\\'s best to calculate your ratio and, if necessary, adjust your spending, pay down debt, or increase your income to bring down your ratio.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 4. Set Your Sights on a Less-Expensive Property\\n\\n\\n If you can\\'t qualify for the mortgage amount you want and you aren\\'t willing to wait, you could choose a smaller home with fewer bedrooms, bathrooms, or square footage. A home in a more distant neighborhood may also provide you with more affordable options.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n If necessary, you could even move to a different part of the country where the cost of homeownership is lower. When your financial situation improves over time, you might be able to trade up to your ideal property, neighborhood, or city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 5. Ask the Lender for an Exception\\n\\n\\n Believe it or not, asking the lender to send your file to someone else within the company for a second opinion on a rejected loan application is possible. In asking for an exception, you\\'ll need to have a very good reason, and you\\'ll need to write a carefully worded letter defending your case.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n If you have a one-time event—such as a [charged-off](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chargeoff.asp) account—impacting your credit, explain why the incident was a one-time event and that it will never occur again. For example, a one-time event could be due to unexpected medical expenses, natural disasters, divorce, or a death in the family (the blemish on your record will actually need to have been a one-time event). Also, you\\'ll need to be able to back your story up with an otherwise solid credit history.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 6. Consider Other Lenders and FHA Loans\\n\\n\\n Banks don\\'t all have the same credit requirements for a mortgage. For example, a large bank that doesn\\'t underwrite many mortgage loans will likely operate differently than a mortgage company that specializes in [home loans](https://www.investopedia.com/best-mortgage-lenders-5076852). Local banks and community banks are also great options. The key is to ask many questions regarding their requirements; from there, you can assess which financial institution is right for you. Just remember, banks can\\'t discourage you from applying. (It\\'s illegal for them to do so.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n In other words, one lender may say no, while another may say yes. However, if every lender rejects you for the same reason, you\\'ll know it\\'s not the lender, and you\\'ll need to correct any issues holding you back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Some banks have programs for low-to-moderate-income borrowers, which might be part of the FHA loan program. An FHA loan is a mortgage insured by the\\xa0Federal Housing Administration\\xa0(FHA), which means the FHA reduces banks\\' risk of issuing mortgage loans. The advantage of FHA loans is that they require lower\\xa0down payments\\xa0and credit scores than most traditional mortgage loans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ## How Much Can I Borrow for a Mortgage Based on My Income?\\n\\n\\nHow much you can borrow depends on your income and debt level. The less you owe, and the more you make, the more you can borrow. One often-repeated rule of thumb is you should try to borrow less than 30% of what you\\'d bring home after taxes and other debts over the mortgage term. So, if your post-tax/debt income is $60,000 per year, 30 years of income is $1,800,000, and 30% of that is $540,000 (this figure is the total amount you\\'d end up paying in interest, insurance, and fees over the term, not the home value). Another way to estimate it is monthly payments of less than 30% of your monthly take-home income.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ## What Factors Qualify You for a Mortgage?\\n\\n\\nMost banks look at your debt-to-income ratio, credit history, score, and income to determine whether you can pay off a mortgage. However, there might be other factors specific to your lender.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ## How Much Income Do I Need to Qualify for a $250,000 Mortgage?\\n\\n\\nHow much income you need depends on your credit history, score, debt-to-income ratio, interest rate, and the length of the mortgage. It\\'s best to talk to a lender for an accurate estimate of how much you\\'d need to make.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## The Bottom Line\\n\\n\\n If you\\'re concerned about getting approved for a mortgage, following these six steps can get you on track to getting approved. Also, be sure to ask your lender what else you can do to get approved. When you know what lenders look for, you can arrange your financial situation to meet their lending requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n It is much easier and more enjoyable to take the income, the money we have earned and worked hard to receive, and spend all of it every month — purchasing whatever we want and not thinking about the future. The problem, when it comes to money, is that we just aren\\'t planning and putting away enough. According to a study by Ramsey Solutions conducted in the second quarter of 2023, 33% of Americans have no savings at all, and 51% do not have savings of at least $1,000.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n That\\'s a pity, because there are [so many reasons to save for the future](https://www.investopedia.com/save-for-a-home-or-retirement-8599275). The future doesn\\'t just have to be retirement — the future is tomorrow. Saving means allowing a break from the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle or allowing for a big purchase down the road, like a vehicle, vacation, or house. Living paycheck-to-paycheck, surprisingly, isn\\'t just something that happens to those earning lower incomes, but to anyone unable to create a budget and follow it, in addition to to making savings goals and reaching them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Between today and the\\xa0conclusion of our income-earning days, a lot can and will happen. We might lose our job(s), take a pay increase or decrease, move, or become unable to work.\\xa0Strategizing about\\xa0the income we make now to devise plans for the future is one of the best things we can do with our hard-earned money.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Key Takeaways\\n\\n\\n* Saving sufficiently for the future — defined as either tomorrow or three decades from now — is crucial.\\n* Key steps for saving include making a budget (with a live-in partner if you have one), reviewing your expenses, and understanding your household\\'s cash flow.\\n* Other key steps include automating your savings, looking for ways to economize by distinguishing between wants and needs, and setting an example for kids.\\n* Do remember to build in the occasional splurge.\\n* The best time to start saving? Right now.\\n\\n## Specific Steps for Saving\\n\\n\\n Once you realize the importance of saving and\\xa0the role that it plays in your life, creating goals is the next step\\xa0to stay on track. Part of setting financial goals is making sure you can meet them. You can\\xa0use an online savings calculator, for example, to make sure your needs\\xa0align with\\xa0your plan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Armed with the education and tools to create realistic goals for your money, it is time to find and dedicate the money to reach your goals.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 1. Make a Budget\\n\\n\\n The first thing you need to do is have a budget and stick to it. This includes being realistic about your household financial situation and setting honest and attainable numbers corresponding to your spending so that you can save. Saying you will save and thinking about saving is not enough. You will have to be intentional about what you do with your money.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 2. Understand the Concept of Cash Flow\\n\\n\\n You need to understand cash flow: what it is, how it works, and what your personal household outgo looks like. Review your income and expenses and see where your spending habits lay. Be intentional about making changes to things you can in order to have money available to save.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 3. Work With Your Partner\\n\\n\\n If you are married or live with someone, communication and teamwork concerning your household finances\\xa0are crucial. To save, you both need to be on board\\xa0with your desires, plans, and resources. The best-laid plans without everyone on board will meet turmoil.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 4. Distinguish Between \"Want\" and \"Need\"\\n\\n\\n Understand the differences between needs and wants and\\xa0identify yours. Be able to say no when something doesn\\'t align with your financial goals, today and in the future.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 5. Make It Automatic\\n\\n\\n Automate savings so\\xa0the\\xa0money\\xa0stays. If you wait until the end of the month to save, the likelihood will be that there is not much left to save. Make it automatic and have money deposited straight out of your paycheck, or have a portion go into a savings account whenever you make a deposit. If you have a few savings objectives, you can track the money you put into each account and put it through one account or\\xa0use a few different savings accounts open for various goals. When you see your savings\\' growth, you are more likely to keep it there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \"If your employer provides a retirement savings plan, consider contributing to it,\" said [Indraneel Chakraborty](https://www.bus.miami.edu/thought-leadership/faculty/finance/chakraborty.html), an Associate Professor of Finance at the Miami Herbert Business School. \"If your employer does not offer a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, then consider opening a Roth IRA. Invest in these accounts using total market index funds with low expense ratios.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 6. Do a Review\\n\\n\\n Sometimes we do not even realize what we are spending each month until we examine it. Review everything you pay for. What are you buying that you might not need? If you do need it, is there a way to get it for less?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 7. Look for Places to Cut\\n\\n\\n What expenses or items can you cut to\\xa0enhance your savings goals? Here are five key areas to review for opportunities to save: energy and utilities, food and groceries, banking and credit card fees, taxes, and auto expenses (i.e., gas and insurance).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 8. Think of the Children\\n\\n\\n Also, take into consideration your children. It is incredibly important to teach them about savings and spending. It is also crucial to set an example: They mirror your behaviors and will take your lead on the role of money in their lives.\\xa0Some essential lessons include waiting to purchase something you want, saving, identifying specific ways for children to save (such as using jars or envelopes), making wise choices, and understanding that when\\xa0money is spent, it can not be spent somewhere else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 9. Start Now\\n\\n\\n Remember that, whatever your goal is, start now. Something will always come up and compete for your resources. Saving for the future should stay in the forefront of your mind, and your finances, regardless of whatever else comes around.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 10. Enjoy Life\\n\\n\\n Yes, we\\'ve been preaching the virtues of discipline, belt-tightening, and resisting instant gratification. But everyone is only human. Recognizing the importance of savings doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t now and again spend on things for fun, relaxation, celebrations, or just for the hell of it. But be sure to build the occasional splurge into your budget.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## The Bottom Line\\n\\n\\n The above strategies will help you to stick to a budget and save for your goals all while allowing for some budgeted fun. Remember, a goal without a plan is just a wish. Write it down, create the time and opportunity, and make it happen.\\n\\n\\n\\n Saving money is central to achieving both short- and long-term financial goals, such as building an [emergency fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emergency_fund.asp), saving for a vacation, or putting aside money toward a down payment on a home. As of January 2022, the [personal savings rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/savings-rate.asp) was 6.4%, meaning that the average U.S. household saves less than 10% of disposable income annually. Creating a savings plan can help to increase your personal savings rate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\n* A savings plan is a blueprint for achieving your financial goals, which may include saving for emergencies or planning for retirement.\\n* Creating a realistic budget can help with developing a consistent savings plan.\\n* Automating deposits into savings or investment accounts can help you avoid spending money that would otherwise be earmarked for saving.\\n* Reviewing your savings plan regularly can help you gauge your progress and determine whether any adjustments are necessary.\\n\\n## Understanding a Savings Plan\\n\\n\\n A savings plan is a method for amassing money in order to reach specific financial goals. It enumerates the goals in question and the steps needed to reach them. Such goals may include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Emergency savings\\n* Vacation plans\\n* Wedding arrangements\\n* Buying a home\\n* Home repairs or improvements\\n* Purchasing a vehicle\\n* College planning\\n* Retirement savings\\n\\n\\n\\n The types of financial goals you include in a savings plan will depend on your individual financial situation.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\nSaving and [investing](https://www.investopedia.com/investing-4427685) aren’t the same thing because saving usually means adding money to a bank account, while investing means putting your money into the stock market.\\n\\n\\n## How to Create a Savings Plan\\n\\n\\n Creating a personalized savings plan doesn’t have to be complicated. Here is a checklist to follow that can make the process easier.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Step 1: Start with a financial inventory\\n\\n\\n Knowing where you stand financially can help you determine your starting point for shaping a savings plan. Begin by creating a financial inventory, which is simply a list of your [liquid assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidasset.asp) and [liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liability.asp).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Assets could include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Cash\\n* Checking account\\n* Savings account\\n* [Money market account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneymarketaccount.asp)\\n* [Certificate of deposit (CD)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp)\\n* [401(k) plan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/401kplan.asp) (and other [employer-sponsored retirement plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/employer_sponsored_plan.asp))\\n* [Individual retirement account (IRA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ira.asp)\\n* [Health savings account (HSA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hsa.asp)\\n* [Brokerage account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brokerageaccount.asp)\\n\\n\\n\\n These are assets you could tap into for cash fairly quickly. You may also have other assets that are less liquid, such as vehicles or homes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Liabilities could include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Credit card debt\\n* Student loan\\n* Car loan\\n* Mortgage\\n* Business loan\\n* [Personal loan](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-loan-5076027)\\n* Medical bills\\n\\n\\n\\n Subtracting your total liabilities from your total assets will give you your [net worth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/networth.asp). According to Federal Reserve data, total household net worth reached $141.7 trillion as of the second quarter of 2021. According to a 2019 survey from the Federal Reserve, the average net worth is around $748,000, while the [median](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/median.asp) net worth is closer to $121,000.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\nYou can use an online calculator to estimate your net worth as part of your financial inventory.\\n\\n\\n### Step 2: Establish your savings goals\\n\\n\\n The next step is determining goals, whether short term or long term, to include in your savings plan. Short-term goals include things you need to save money for in the near term. For example, one of your priorities may be saving for emergencies. This is a fairly common goal: 45% of workers say that paying for a $400 emergency expense out of pocket would be difficult, according to a 2021 Bipartisan Policy Center survey.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Long-term goals don’t require immediate cash. Retirement and college are but two examples. In terms of the amount saved, long-term goals may be larger than short-term goals, but you have a longer time frame in which to execute your savings plan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n When setting financial goals for your savings plan, keep them S.M.A.R.T.:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Specific\\n* Measurable\\n* Achievable\\n* Realistic\\n* Time bound\\n\\n\\n\\n For example, rather than creating a vague goal like saving money for emergencies, you could set a S.M.A.R.T. goal of saving $10,000 in 12 months. This goal is specific because you have a set dollar amount in mind and measurable because you can track your progress month to month. There’s also a time element because you’re giving yourself 12 months to reach it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Whether the goal checks off achievable and realistic boxes can depend on how much money you’re able to save each month. This is where the next step in the savings plan process comes into it.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Step 3: Decide how much to allocate to each goal\\n\\n\\n A savings plan only works when you are committed to it and have money to save each month. If you have a monthly budget, then you may already have an idea of how much extra money you have available to save each month. If you’re not a regular budgeter, you’ll need to first add up your income and subtract your expenses [to calculate how much you can realistically afford to save](https://www.investopedia.com/budgeting-calculator-5101411).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Let’s use the average [household income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/household_income.asp) and annual consumer expenditures as an example. According to the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, the typical household made $84,352 in 2020. Meanwhile, the average household spent $61,334.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Using those numbers, the average monthly income works out to $7,029. Average monthly spending is $5,111. If your income and spending align with those numbers, you have roughly $1,918 left each month that you can apply to your savings plan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Now, say you have three savings goals:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Vacation fund: $2,000\\n* Home repair fund: $5,000\\n* Emergency fund: $10,000\\n\\n\\n\\n You want to complete the vacation fund in six months, the home repair fund in six months, and the emergency fund in 12 months. Based on those time frames, here’s how your monthly savings would need to break down:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Vacation fund: $333/month x six months\\n* Home repair fund: $833/month x six months\\n* Emergency fund: $833/month x 12 months\\n\\n\\n\\n The total comes to $1,999, making you $81 shy of what you need to reach your goals. The easiest way to make up for the shortfall would be to review your budget and reduce spending to find $81 you could redirect to savings. Accomplish that and your goal is achievable and realistic, as well as specific, measurable, and time bound.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\nIf you’re contributing to a 401(k) at work through payroll deductions, you wouldn’t include those amounts in your income or expenses.\\n\\n\\n### Step 4: Decide where to keep your savings\\n\\n\\n When you have your goals in mind, you can think about where you want to keep the funds. Your options include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Savings account\\n* Money market account\\n* CD\\n* [Tax-advantaged account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-advantaged.asp)\\n* Taxable investment account\\n\\n\\n\\n The option you choose can depend on the goal. For example, if you’re saving for emergencies, then your money needs to be easily accessible. At the same time, you may want to earn a high rate of interest on your savings. Therefore, a [high-yield savings account](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/high-yield-savings-account.asp) could be the best option.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n With retirement savings, you can choose between tax-advantaged and taxable accounts. Tax-advantaged accounts, such as a 401(k) or an IRA, can yield tax benefits. They are designed for long-term savings because you generally can’t take money out before age 59½ without triggering an early withdrawal penalty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n On the other hand, you can use [online brokerage accounts to invest money](https://www.investopedia.com/best-brokers-for-beginners-4587873) that you may need for short- or long-term goals. The catch, however, is that if you sell assets in a brokerage account for a profit, [you’ll owe capital gains tax](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/capital-gains-tax-101/).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### \\n\\n\\nAutomating deposits into savings accounts, retirement accounts, or investment accounts is a simple way to ensure that you’re making progress toward your goals.\\n\\n\\n### Step 5: Maximize your savings plan\\n\\n\\n When you’ve got your savings plan in place, look for opportunities to make the most of it. For example, if you’re contributing to a 401(k) at work, check your annual contribution limits. Are you contributing enough [to get the full employer match if one is offered](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112315/how-401k-matching-works.asp)? If not, then you may want to contact your benefits coordinator to increase your contributions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n You can also maximize your savings plan by earmarking windfalls or unexpected amounts of money that come your way for one or more of your goals. For example, the average tax refund for 2021 was $2,775. If you typically receive a tax refund, you could put that amount directly into savings so there’s no temptation to spend it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Reviewing your savings plan monthly can help you see how much progress you’re making. You can also review your spending and budget to look for any extra money you might be able to save, which is another way to maximize your plan.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ## What Is a Personal Savings Plan?\\n\\n\\nA personal savings plan is a plan for saving money that typically revolves around distinct financial goals. A comprehensive savings plan may include both [short-term and long-term financial goals](https://www.investopedia.com/save-for-a-home-or-retirement-8599275) and is customized to your income, time horizon, and ability to save.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ## How Do You Make a Savings Plan?\\n\\n\\nMaking a savings plan starts with creating a financial inventory, then setting clear financial goals. When you’ve done that, you can calculate what you can afford to save each month, how much to allocate to each savings plan goal, and where to keep your savings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n ## What Is a Good Savings Plan?\\n\\n\\nA good savings plan is one that allows you to identify which financial goals are most important to you, prioritize those goals, and achieve them in a time frame that you prefer. Every savings plan is different based on what you hope to achieve with your money, how long you have to save, and how much you can afford to commit to savings.\\n\\n\\n',\n"," {'How To Save for a House: A Step-by-Step Guide': 'https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092815/where-should-i-keep-my-down-payment-savings.asp',\n","  'Should You Save for a Home or Retirement?': 'https://www.investopedia.com/save-for-a-home-or-retirement-8599275',\n","  '6 Tips for Getting Approved for a Mortgage': 'https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgage-real-estate/08/mortgage-application-rejected.asp',\n","  '10 Ways to Effectively Save for the Future': 'https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100615/10-ways-effectively-save-future.asp',\n","  'Do You Need a Savings Plan?

Here's a breakdown of how to save for a down payment:\\n\\n**1. Assess Your Current Financial Situation:**\\n\\n* **Know Your Numbers:**  Figure out your income, expenses, and debt.

Most lenders require a minimum credit score of 620 or above for conventional mortgages.\\n* **Debt-to-Income Ratio:**  Calculate your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). This measures the percentage of your gross income that goes towards debt payments. Most banks prefer a DTI below 36%.\\n\\n**2. Set a Clear Savings Goal:**\\n\\n* **Housing Budget:**  Use the 28/36 rule as a guideline. This rule suggests spending no more than 28% of your gross monthly income on housing expenses and no more than 36% on all debt payments.\\n* **Down Payment and Closing Costs:**  Factor in the down payment (typically 6-7% for first-time buyers) and closing costs (3-6% of the purchase price).\\n* **Mortgage Calculator:**  Use a mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly payments and get a clearer picture of your affordability.\\n\\n**3. Develop a Savings Plan:**\\n\\n* **Separate Savings Account:**  Open a high-yield savings account specifically for your down payment. This helps you stay focused and avoid dipping into your savings.\\n* **Automate Your Savings:**  Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account. This ensures you're consistently saving.\\n* **Lifestyle Changes:**  Consider making adjustments to your spending habits. This could involve cutting back on non-essentials, finding side hustles, or even moving in with family to save on rent.\\n\\n**4. Cut Back on Expenses:**\\n\\n* **Review Your Spending:**  Identify areas where you can cut back, such as cable/streaming services, dining out, entertainment, and subscriptions.\\n* **Negotiate Discounts:**  Call your providers for services like insurance, cable, and internet to see if you can get better rates.\\n\\n**5. Increase Your Income:**\\n\\n* **Side Hustles:**  Explore ways to earn extra income, such as freelance work, driving for a ride-sharing service, or starting a small business.\\n* **Passive Income:**  Look for passive income opportunities, like renting out a spare room or investing in dividend-paying stocks.\\n\\n**6. Explore Down Payment Assistance Programs:**\\n\\n* **Government Programs:**  Research programs like FHA loans, VA loans, USDA loans, and HUD Good Neighbor Next Door. These programs offer down payment assistance and other benefits for first-time homebuyers.\\n* **Local Programs:**  Check with your city, county, and state for local homebuying programs.\\n* **Lender Programs:**  Some lenders offer down payment assistance programs.\\n\\n**7. Save Windfalls and Extra Income:**\\n\\n* **Tax Refunds:**  Set aside any tax refunds or bonuses you receive.\\n* **Unexpected Income:**  Earmark any unexpected income, like inheritances or legal settlements, for your down payment.\\n\\n**8. Monitor and Adjust Your Savings Plan:**\\n\\n* **Track Your Progress:**  Keep track of your savings progress to stay motivated.\\n* **Revisit Your Budget:**  Review your spending plan regularly and make adjustments as needed.\\n\\n**Remember:** Saving for a house is a marathon, not a sprint.
